# Portfolio Site
====
Hi! Thank you for checking out this repo.
I built this site to showcase my work, as well as stretch my new skills in vue.

Here are some key aspects of this site:
* Uses VueJS
* Uses VueRouter
* Uses VueX
* Has Firebase Integration with bespoke blog creation and editing
* Uses user authentication to allow privilaged users to write posts (This is strictly on the firebase end)
* Inline SVGs for higher page speeds, and more flexibility
* No-Library CSS Animations and layouts
* Uses reusable markdown component to format posts
* Flexbox and CSS Grid
* BEM CSS Class notation

This is a Vue js and Firebase single page application which should hopefully showcase my previous work, while being a great showcase of my skill in itself!
